# Story Generation

Expand a user-provided logline into a structured animation screenplay saved as `story.md`.

## Target Duration → Scene Count

Scale scenes to match the intended video length. Each scene = 1–3 shots × 8 sec.

| Target length | Shots needed | Scenes to write |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ~30 seconds   | 3–4 shots   | 2–3 scenes      |
| ~60 seconds   | 7–8 shots   | 4–6 scenes      |
| ~2 minutes    | 15 shots    | 6–10 scenes     |
| ~3–5 minutes  | 20–37 shots | 8–15 scenes     |

> **Default if no duration specified:** aim for 8–15 scenes (~3–5 min).
> Ask the user for target duration if not provided — it changes the scene count significantly.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the logline: identify genre, tone, conflict arc, and resolution.
2. Write the number of scenes appropriate for the target duration (see table above).
3. Each scene must include:
   - **Scene number and title**
   - **Location**: detailed visual description (used for background image generation)
   - **Characters present**: with brief visual descriptions on first appearance
   - **Action and dialogue**: visual storytelling focus (show, don't tell)
   - **Shot Notes**: suggested camera angles/movements (wide, close-up, tracking, etc.)
   - **Tone/Pacing**: emotional beat
4. Write for 3D animation: visually descriptive and action-oriented.
5. Keep character count manageable (3–6 main characters).
6. Reuse backgrounds across scenes where natural — reduces image generation cost.
